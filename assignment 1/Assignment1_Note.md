# Exercise 1. Modeling Sparse Matrix-Vector Multiply

The goal of this exercise is to estimate the performance of sparse matrix-vector multiply for different sparse matrix sizes and compare it to actual performance measurements.

We will consider matrices with $nrows = 10^2, 10^4, 10^6,$ and $10^8$.
